I'm a PhD student at the University of California, Santa Barbara in the department of Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology. I study coastal ecology, with a focus on coral reefs and the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning. I built this website using `distill` to provide some simple but diverse **coding examples** in `R` and to house my **electronic lab notebook**. I'm new to electronic lab notebooks but am trying to integrate them into my workflow as part of my commitment to open science. My lab notebook was inspired by the Putnam Lab's layout on Github, which you can Fork to create your own notebook [here](https://github.com/Putnam-Lab/Lab_Management/blob/master/Lab_Resourses/Laboratory_Notebooks/Forked-Lab-Notebook-and%20Posts.md)
