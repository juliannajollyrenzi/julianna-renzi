The website is live here and the code I wrote to make the app can be found here. I’m hoping that the app will be a useful tool in showing the importance of long term research and could potentially be used in interactive outreach activities that show how long-term data can be used to spot trends over time and potential relationships between variables.\n\n\n\n",
