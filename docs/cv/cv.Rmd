## About

I study community ecology and the role of biodiversity in ecosystem stability. I work in coastal environments, with a current focus on coral reefs, although I've conducted research in salt marsh, oyster reef, mangrove, and desert ecosystems. I'm currently a first year PhD student in the Burkepile lab at UC Santa Barbara where I am studying the coral reefs of Mo'orea, French Polynesia. I love coding, data analysis, and Thai food.
