      "description": "I study community ecology and the role of biodiversity in ecosystem stability. I work in coastal environments, with a current focus on coral reefs, although I've conducted research in salt marsh, oyster reef, mangrove, and desert ecosystems. I'm currently a first year PhD student in the Burkepile lab at UC Santa Barbara where I am studying the coral reefs of Mo'orea, French Polynesia. I love coding, data analysis, and thai food. If you have any questions or comments on what you see, please reach out (contact information on the Home page). ",

I study coastal ecology, with a focus on coral reefs and the role of biodiversity in ecosystem functioning. I built this website using distill to provide some simple but diverse coding examples in R and to house my electronic lab notebook. I’m new to electronic lab notebooks but am integrating one into my workflow as part of my commitment to open science. My lab notebook was inspired by the Putnam Lab’s layout on Github, which you can Fork to create your own notebook here.
