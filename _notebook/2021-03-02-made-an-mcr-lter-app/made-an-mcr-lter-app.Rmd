I've spent the past couple of months exploring the Mo'orea Coral Reef LTER data (read more here: http://mcr.lternet.edu/) and created an interactive `shiny` app to visualize a couple of the core time series. The website is live [here](https://juliannarenzi.shinyapps.io/MCR_LTER_explore/) and the code I wrote to make the app can be found [here](https://github.com/juliannajollyrenzi/LTER_Shiny_app). 
I'm hoping that the app will be a useful tool in showing the importance of long term research and could potentially be used in interactive outreach activities that show how long-term data can be used to spot trends over time and potential relationships between variables.
