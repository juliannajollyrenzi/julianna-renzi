```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```

To make future posts:

- Type `require(distill)` into the console
- Use `create_post(title = "Post name here", collection = "notebook")` to specify a new lab notebook post
- Or use `create_post(title = "Post name here", collection = "posts")` to specify a new code example post
- Be sure to `knit` and push to `Git` after every new post
