	abstract = {Increasing rates of sea-level rise and wave action threaten coastal populations. Defense of shorelines by protection and restoration of wetlands has been invoked as a win-win strategy for humans and nature, yet evidence from field experiments supporting the wetland protection function is uncommon, as is the understanding of its context dependency. Here we provide evidence from field manipulations showing that the loss of wetland vegetation, regardless of disturbance size, increases the rate of erosion on wave-stressed shorelines. Vegetation removal (simulated disturbance) along the edge of salt marshes reveals that loss of wetland plants elevates the rate of lateral erosion and that extensive root systems, rather than aboveground biomass, are primarily responsible for protection against edge erosion in marshes. Meta-analysis further shows that disturbances that generate plant die-off on salt marsh edges generally hasten edge erosion in coastal marshes and that the erosion protection function of wetlands relates more to lateral than vertical edge-erosional processes and is positively correlated with the amount of belowground plant biomass lost. Collectively, our findings substantiate a coastal protection paradigm that incorporates preservation of shoreline vegetation, illuminate key context dependencies in this theory, and highlight local disturbances (e.g., oil spills) that kill wetland plants as agents that can accelerate coastal erosion.},

	abstract = {Worldwide, many coral reef ecosystems have shifted from coral to algal dominance, yet the ecological function of these emergent communities remains relatively unknown. Turbinaria ornata, a macroalga with a rapidly expanding range in the South Pacific, forms dense stands on hard substrate, likely providing ecological services unique from corals. While generally unpalatable, T. ornata can function as a secondary foundation species and hosts an epibiont community that may provide overlooked trophic resources in phase shifted reef ecosystems. Results from video recorded field experiments designed to quantify consumer pressure on T. ornata epibionts showed that both consumer pressure and epibiont cover increased with thallus size. Additionally, most fish species, including herbivores, omnivores, and detritivores, exhibited higher bite rates on thalli with epibionts compared to thali with epibionts experimentally removed. Juvenile parrotfishes were responsible for 50\% of total bites recorded and also had the highest bite rates. Results indicate that epibionts, particularly on large T. ornata, are a food resource for a diversity of fishes, representing a previously undescribed function of this macroalga in coral reef ecosystems. Exploring the functions of macroalgal dominated reef communities will be increasingly important as reefs continue to phase shift toward macroalgal dominance in the Anthropocene.},

	abstract = {Premise of the Study Phenology is the study of biological life cycle events, such as flowering and migration. Climate patterns can alter these life history events, having ecosystem-wide ramifications. For example, warmer springs are associated with earlier leaf-out for many species, impacting species interactions and growing-season carbon dynamics. While phenological research has been conducted extensively in temperate regions, relatively little is known about the phenological responses in arid and semi-arid regions. Methods In this study we looked at the flowering phenology of a keystone species in the Sonoran Desert, the saguaro cactus (Carnegiea gigantea). The timing and abundance of flowering was observed on 151 individuals for 10 years at a site near Tucson, Arizona, {USA}. Using six phenological traits, we explored the relationship between saguaro size and flowering and the climatic drivers of flowering. Key Results Our analyses demonstrated how the calculation of phenological traits at the individual versus the population level can yield differing responses to climate variability, suggesting that not all studies examining the same trait (e.g., first day of bloom) are directly comparable. We found that larger cacti began flowering earlier, flowered for longer, and produced more flowers. Warmer temperatures were correlated with advanced onset and higher bloom yields, while increased precipitation appeared to delay onset and reduce bloom yields. Conclusions Given that climate models predict that the Southwestern {USA} will become increasingly warmer with more variable precipitation, saguaros may begin flowering earlier in the season and flower more intensely, which could impact pollen availability and population dynamics.},

	abstract = {Over 85\% of the world’s oyster reefs have been lost in the past two centuries, triggering a global effort to restore shellfish reef ecosystems and the ecosystem services they provide. While there has been considerable success in reestablishing oyster reefs, many challenges remain. These include: high incidence of failed restoration, high cost of restoration per unit area, and increasing stress from climate change, which now imperils many restored reefs. In order to leverage our past successes and progress the field, we must increase restoration efficiencies that not only reduce cost per unit area, but also increase the resilience of restored ecosystems. To address this need, we review the literature associated with the structure and function of oyster reef ecosystems to identify key positive species interactions (i.e. those species interactions where at least one partner benefits and no partners are harmed) that, if systematically incorporated into restoration planning, have the potential to greatly increase restoration outcomes and success. We classified positive inter- and intraspecific feedbacks between oysters and organisms associated with oyster ecosystems into the following seven functional categories: 1) physical reef creation, 2) positive density dependence, 3) refugia from physical stress, 4) refugia from biological stress, 5) biodiversity enhancement, 6) improvement of settlement, and 7) long-distance facilitation. We discuss each category of interaction positive feedback and how restoration practitioners can use knowledge of such processes to alter management and enhance restoration success. We propose that systematic incorporation of positive species interactions that generate these feedbacks into restoration practice may enhance ecological services provided by restored reefs and increase restoration success.},

	abstract = {In an era of rapid coastal population expansion and habitat degradation, restoration is becoming an increasingly important strategy for combating coastal habitat loss and maintaining ecosystem services. In particular, techniques that use habitat restoration alone or restoration in combination with built infrastructure to provide coastal protective services are growing in popularity. These novel approaches, often called living shorelines, have the potential to expand the reach and applicability of coastal restoration projects. To understand how living shorelines research has expanded over time, we conducted a scoping review of English-language peer-reviewed articles. We included papers that self-identified as living shorelines research, as well as studies that used other related terminology, to investigate trends in publication rates, geography, site characteristics, and outcomes measured. Using a systematic search protocol, we compiled a database of 46 papers; the earliest study was published in 1981, and the earliest study to use the term living shoreline was published in 2008. Eighty-three percent of studies were conducted in North America, followed by 11\% in Asia, and 7\% in Europe, but the use of the term living shoreline was almost exclusively restricted to North America. Saltmarshes, oyster reefs, mangroves, and freshwater vegetation were used in living shoreline designs, but 91\% of studies also incorporated structural materials like oyster shell and rock. Most living shorelines research was conducted at sites that were less than five years old. The vast majority of studies exclusively reported on ecological outcomes (89\%), and of those, ecological processes were measured in 74\% of studies. Processes related to coastal protection were measured most frequently (52\% of ecological studies), followed by biological interactions, water filtration, nutrient cycling, and carbon sequestration. All together, our data suggest that living shorelines research is on the rise, but there is a need for more long-term data, socio-economic research, further consensus on the terminology used to describe different types of projects, and research on the types of living shorelines that are most effective in different environmental contexts. Future long-term and interdisciplinary research will help to elucidate the full effects of living shorelines.},

	abstract = {Understanding patterns of habitat use by newborn-sized animals is critical to conserving threatened species and their potential nursery grounds. Giant Shovelnose Rays (Glaucostegus typus) are Critically Endangered but at least locally abundant in the Australian portion of their range, providing an opportunity in Australia to understand what types of habitat features are associated with newborn and young-of-the-year individuals in the absence of intense fishing pressure. To investigate this, we used replicated belt transects to study Giant Shovelnose habitat use and abundance in shallow ({\textless} 0.5 m), shoreline waters. 28 whole-island surveys were conducted at low tide over 2 years on Heron Island, Australia. In total, we counted 552 Giant Shovelnose Rays, 79\% of which were newborn class ({\textless} 40 cm in length), in both sand flats and shallow areas with rock rubble. These habitat characteristics are consistent with other studies of Giant Shovelnose Rays in Australia, adding to the existing knowledge that these juvenile animals commonly use shallow waters. Studying newborn Giant Shovelnose habitat characteristics in a portion of their range where they are still locally abundant can offer a roadmap for managers to locate key regions to protect within imperiled portions of their range.},

	abstract = {As coral populations decline across the Caribbean, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the forces that inhibit coral survivorship and recovery. Predation by corallivores, such as the short coral snail Coralliophila abbreviata, are one such threat to coral health and recovery worldwide, but current understanding of the factors controlling corallivore populations, and therefore predation pressure on corals, remains limited. To examine the extent to which bottom-up forces (i.e., coral prey), top-down forces (i.e., predators), and marine protection relate to C. abbreviata distributions, we surveyed C. abbreviata abundance, percent coral cover, and the abundance of potential snail predators across six protected and six unprotected reefs in the Florida Keys. We found that C. abbreviata abundance was lower in protected areas where predator assemblages were also more diverse, and that across all sites snail abundance generally increased with coral cover. C. abbreviata abundance had strong, negative relationships with two gastropod predators—the Caribbean spiny lobster (Panulirus argus) and the grunt black margate (Anisotremus surinamensis), which may be exerting top-down pressure on C. abbreviata populations. Further, we found the size of C. abbreviata was also related to reef protection status, with larger C. abbreviata on average in protected areas, suggesting that gape-limited predators such as P. argus and A. surinamensis may alter size distributions by targeting small snails. Combined, these results provide preliminary evidence that marine protection in the Florida Keys may preserve critical trophic interactions that indirectly promote coral success via control of local populations of the common corallivorous snail C. abbreviata.},

	abstract = {Coastal wetlands are among the most productive ecosystems in the world. They generate critical services for humans including shoreline protection, carbon storage, pollution mitigation, and fisheries production. Restoration of coastal wetlands has historically been viewed as a secondary conservation strategy, but recently—given the continued loss of wetlands worldwide—many non-governmental and governmental organizations have elevated habitat restoration to be a primary method for wetland conservation. The long-held paradigm in coastal wetland restoration has been to restore target habitats by reducing physical stressors and avoiding competition among outplants, such as mangrove saplings or Spartina plugs. Recent ecological research, however, reveals that positive species interactions, such as facilitation, are critical to wetland recovery after disturbance. Here, we review the scientific evidence for the importance of positive species interactions in the recovery of salt-marsh and mangrove ecosystems and assess the extent to which they have been integrated into restoration studies. We found that only a small proportion of studies of marsh and mangrove restoration examined the effects of positive species interactions, despite the important role they play in the regrowth of coastal wetlands. We outline how positive species interactions can be systematically incorporated into future restoration work and discuss how this incorporation can help the reestablishment of coastal wetland biota through: (1) trophic facilitation, (2) stress reduction, and (3) associational defenses. The absence of positive interactions in restoration designs may partially explain the significant disparities between the functioning of natural and restored coastal plant ecosystems.},
